# RetroPie-Internet-Radio
Play streaming internet radio in retropie/emulationstation.

The instal.sh script will install (c)vlc player and make a 'radio' folder in your roms dir.
In this 'radio' folder you can place '.pls .PLS .m3u .M3U .radio .RADIO' files
Which will be loaded by emultors.cfg and es_systems.cfg

There is also a 'controls' dir in which there are some shell scripts to control (c)vlc player.
